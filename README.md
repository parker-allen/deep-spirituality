# scripture-of-the-day

This is a program I wrote for an affialate company for the comapny I was an intern at. They needed scriptures from each of the devotionals they wrote so that they could post "Scripture of the Day" and link it back to a devotional.

It goes through each page of devotionals, grabs any new links that it hasn't parsed already, grabs each scripture and scripture reference, and populates a Google Sheet that the social media team uses to post scriptures.

I will re-run this program every month or so, and it will get the new devotionals and update the Google Sheet. Giving them around 3 years of scriptures of the day.
